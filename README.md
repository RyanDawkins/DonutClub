# DonutClub

Donut Club is an app that I came up with to serve the need of our "donut club" that we have at my work.
Basically we were originally managing the club and it's members in an excel spreadhseet at first. Having to rely
on email in order to find out who was going to go to the events. 

This application is open source under the MIT license.
